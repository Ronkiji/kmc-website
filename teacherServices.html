          <h1>Teacher Services</h1>
          <h3>General Notes to Teachers</h3>

          <p>In order to have your students perform at our Sunday concerts, both you and your student must complete and mail
            in membership forms and fees for the current season.</p>

          <p>
            Teachers may then register their students for performance by submitting a concert request
            form as outlined in “Concert Request Form” under Teacher’s Services.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are usually two and sometimes three concerts scheduled on a concert Sunday beginning at 2:15. Students and
            their teachers will be assigned a particular concert time which
            will be posted on the web site under Concert Times one week prior to the concert.
          </p>

          <p>
            In view of the number of students and teachers that we serve, it is not possible to accommodate requests for
            specific concert times. Please ensure that your students
            understand this need for availability on their part before you submit their concert request form.
          </p>

          <p>
            All attending teachers are asked to mark the performances. Teacher marking sheets will be available at the desk
            and should be put into the envelope for the Director of Scholarships
            after the concert. Generally, the marks should follow the music festival system, using the range from the high
            70’s to the low 90’s, with the marks mainly ranging from 80 to 88%.
            Please mark ALL performances as this is a safeguard in case of any clerical slips in the scholarship programme
            and also ensures that students are tracked for the Lillian Jackson Trophy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Please remember to advise families that are new to concert etiquette that it is important to stay for the entire
            concert to provide an audience for other club members. In the unusual
            case where someone must enter or exit the hall during the concert, please advise them to do so very discreetly,
            and only between performances.
          </p>

          <p>
            All performance material must be well prepared, preferably memorized, prior to each performance. Students should
            be reminded to dress appropriately.
          </p>

          <h3>Notes regarding the Scholarship Program</h3>
          <p>
            Teachers may register their students in the graded scholarship program by submitting the scholarship application
            form as outlined under “Scholarship Application”.
            This form should be received by the club prior to the student’s first performance of scholarship repertoire.
            This
            programme is optional for students, and many students perform
            in the club without registering for the scholarship programme. About twenty five scholarships are awarded each
            season, and there is an effort to award at least one scholarship
            from every grade level.
          </p>

          <p>
            Scholarship repertoire should be chosen according to the graded outline (see below) and must be performed by
            memory. One piece may be selected from one grade higher,
            as is allowed in conservatory exams.
          </p>

          <p>
            Students up to level 9 who have received a scholarship may not reapply for the same level scholarship in future
            years. At the Grade 10 and ARCT level it is possible to divide
            the required repertoire evenly over two years, becoming eligible for a half scholarship for each year.
          </p>
